## Installation instruction

Docker containers can be set up with
``` bash
docker compose up
```

## Containers

Currently the following containers are created:
 - `grafana` with a Grafana server, exposing port `3000`.
 - `grafana_setup` containing scripts for automatic configuration of grafana.
 Starts running only after `grafana` is fully running. It stops immediately after.
 - `prometheus` containing a Prometheus server, exposing port `9090`.
 - `pushgateway` containing https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway server, exposing port `9091`.
 It can be used for sending metrics, which will then be scraped by Prometheus.
 - `monitoring` containing a Ubuntu image with `qibocal` to be restarted at regular intervals for acquiring QPU metrics.
